      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi my name is David, I'm 22 years old, and I'm an aspiring web developer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I've lived in Washington my entire life, I was born in Renton, then moved out to Sammamish when I was 3 and have lived in the same house ever since.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I really enjoy rock climbing, specifically bouldering, as a hobby; other than that I enjoy cooking, photography, as well as playing video games here and there.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don't really have a dream job but I did want to be a professional photographer at one point.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Sammamish, Washington.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I get really upset when I visit a website, government ones especially, and they're the hardest things in the world to navigate and use. There's a lot of websites that are not very user friendly and I want to learn how to make better ones.</p>
